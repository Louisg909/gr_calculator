# General Relativity Module

## What is it?
This module is being designed to act as an intuative way to incorporate GR equations in Einstein Notation into python. It can be used both as a module, calling objects and equations into you Python Script, but also with a calculator mode, where you can type in the notation and get the correct outputs.



# Building notes:

Index written in numbers when forming the equations, it just numbers the indexes, and then translates them into greek letters by working its way through the "ind" list, which includes all the possible index names in order of preference. Once the list is used up, it goes through them again, numbering them.


# README.md notes:
Should include:
- A brief description of the project
- Installation instructions
- A short example/tutorial
